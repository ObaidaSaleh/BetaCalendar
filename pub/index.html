    <!------- Loading JS scripts ------->
    <!-- When loading JS scripts, considerations should be made regarding when
         the DOM is being loaded, and when different scripts 
         depend on each other. Below are examples of a few different ways to load the scripts.

     -->

     <!-- Load any CSS before the JS in case you need to access styles in your scripts. -->
     <!-- <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="someStylesheet.css"> -->

   	<!-- If you don't use either 'async' or 'defer', the HTML parsing/DOM loading is blocked until the script is downloaded and executed. -->
    <!-- Since it is the top script on the page, it will block 
      before loading everything under it (including the <body>).  -->
     <!-- <script src="example.js"></script> -->

    <!-- 'defer' states that the script should be executed after the HTML is parsed.
         If multiple scripts have 'defer', they are loaded one after the other.  
         This will guarantee execution order, and ensure that scripts that depend on each other load
         in an order that will not cause errors. -->
    <!-- First we load jquery from a Google CDN (content delivery network). -->
    <script defer src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <!-- Then we load a script that depends on jQuery -->
    <script defer type="text/javascript" src='BetaCalendar.js'></script>
    <script defer type="text/javascript" src="example.js"></script>
